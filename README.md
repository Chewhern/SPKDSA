# SPKDSA
A very simplified full stack framework for passwordless authentication using public key digital signature authentication.

Actual PKDSA may be more complex to use in production. It'll also be quite hard to apply it in production.

Similar situations apply to SPKDSA but it'll be simpler.

Once done, I will upload the code and specify the open source license required.

The license choice will either be MIT or AGPL. 

I will also describe the differences and features comparing both versions of PKDSA - SPKDSA and PKDSA.
