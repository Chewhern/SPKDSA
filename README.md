# SPKDSA
A very simplified full stack framework for passwordless authentication using public key digital signature authentication.

## Project Neutrality
This project is licensed under the MIT License to ensure maximum openness and neutrality.  

The goal is to avoid restrictions tied to specific governments, organizations, or jurisdictions.  

## Neutrality-based Code Contributions
To maintain long-term neutrality and legal clarity:  
- All contributions must follow the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md).  
- By contributing, you confirm your work is your own (or you have the rights to submit it).  
- You grant the maintainers the right to use, modify, and relicense your contribution under the projectâ€™s license.  
- This prevents future legal or geopolitical restrictions from affecting the project.  

This approach is consistent with international legal precedents confirming that open-source licenses are enforceable (e.g., *Jacobsen v. Katzer*, BusyBox GPL cases, *Artifex v. Hancom*, *Hellwig v. VMware*).

## Components/Environment required

[Download Dotnet 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Client device requires a desktop environment with resolution of **1920 x 1080**.

On Linux(Ubuntu), you need to execute **apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0**. If such execution was not possible then you can use Windows to compile and deploy on Linux.

### Building applications (On Windows with Visual Studio)
1. Navigate to the source code folder whereby there's ".csproj" inside.
2. Click on the file.
3. Right click on the ".csproj" file inside visual studio and click on "build".
4. The application will reside in "bin/debug".

### Building applications (On MacOS/Linux)
1. Navigate to the source code folder whereby there's ".csproj" inside with command prompt/terminal/console.
2. Do **dotnet build**
3. The application will reside in "bin/debug".

### Building client applications
1. Navigate to a single client's application's both source code folder.
2. Build on the client application without ".Desktop".
3. Build on the client application with ".Desktop".
4. The client application will reside within ".Desktop" folder.
5. Navigate to "bin/debug".

### Run compiled applications (On Windows)
1. Navigate to the respective folder and double click on ".exe".

### Run compiled applications (On MacOS/Linux)
1. Navigate to the respective folder and do **dotnet app.dll**

#### Host and deploy server applications (Web API)

1. Follow the steps accordingly.
2. Change the "User" to the user that has permission on compiled web api server application.
3. Ignore
```
Colon (:) separators aren't supported in environment variable names. Use a double underscore (__) in place of a colon. The Environment Variables configuration provider converts double-underscores into colons when environment variables are read into configuration. In the following example, the connection string key ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection is set into the service definition file as ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection:

Console

Copy
Environment=ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection={Connection String}
Save the file and enable the service.
```
4. Finish until **systemctl**.
