# AvaloniaUI or other UI framework support
The client-side desktop application for this framework is built using the **AvaloniaUI** framework.

For advanced UI/UX enhancements, contributors may consider AvaloniaUIâ€™s official paid support or other community resources.

# Desktop and web UI hybrid
In scenarios similar to the **Steam desktop client**, cross-platform considerations may require combining desktop and web-based UI.

By default, the .NET tech stack only provides browser-based UI rendering for Windows applications.

For broader cross-platform support, external tools such as [DotNetBrowser](https://teamdev.com/dotnetbrowser/) may be required.
