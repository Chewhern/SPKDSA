# CLA (Contributor License Agreement)
*Version 1.0 — Effective Date: 2025-09-26*

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.**  
To protect the neutrality and legal clarity of this project, we ask all contributors to agree to the following terms.  
By submitting code, documentation, or other materials (“Contribution”), you agree:

## 1. License Grant
You grant the project maintainers and all downstream users a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable license** to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense your Contribution under the project’s existing license.  
This grant applies whether your Contribution is merged, modified, or redistributed.

## 2. Copyright & Authorship
You **retain authorship** of your Contribution, but you agree not to assert or enforce any rights that would conflict with the project’s license.  
Your Contribution will be treated as though it were originally licensed with the project, ensuring long-term **license neutrality**.

## 3. Neutrality of Contributions
To avoid legal or jurisdiction-based restrictions, you agree that your Contribution may be freely used regardless of your country of origin or current residence.  
You waive any rights to later impose additional licensing or usage restrictions on your Contribution.

## 4. Certification of Original Work
You certify, to the best of your knowledge, that:
- Your Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to submit it.  
- Submitting it does not violate any agreements you have with others.

## 5. Governing Law
This CLA is intended to be interpreted broadly and neutrally, in alignment with open-source legal precedents (including *Jacobsen v. Katzer* and subsequent GPL/MIT cases).
