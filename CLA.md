# CLA (Contributor License Agreement)


*Version 1.0 — Effective Date: 2025-09-26*

**Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.**  
To protect the neutrality and legal clarity of this project, we ask all contributors to agree to the following terms.  
By submitting code, documentation, or other materials (“Contribution”), you agree:

## 1. License Grant
You grant the project maintainers and all downstream users a **perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable license** to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense your Contribution under the project’s existing license.  
This grant applies whether your Contribution is merged, modified, or redistributed.

## 2. Copyright & Authorship
You **retain authorship** of your Contribution, but you agree not to assert or enforce any rights that would conflict with the project’s license.  
Your Contribution will be treated as though it were originally licensed with the project, ensuring long-term **license neutrality**.

## 3. Neutrality of Contributions
To avoid legal or jurisdiction-based restrictions, you agree that your Contribution may be freely used regardless of your country of origin or current residence.  
You waive any rights to later impose additional licensing or usage restrictions on your Contribution.

## 4. Certification of Original Work
You certify, to the best of your knowledge, that:
- Your Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to submit it.  
- Submitting it does not violate any agreements you have with others.

## 5. Governing Law
This CLA is intended to be interpreted broadly and neutrally, in alignment with established open-source legal precedents.  
Notable examples include:  
- *Jacobsen v. Katzer* (2008, U.S. Federal Court) – confirmed that open-source licenses are enforceable.  
- BusyBox enforcement cases (2007–2010, U.S. Federal Courts) – clarified that GPL violations can lead to legal remedies.  
- *Artifex Software, Inc. v. Hancom, Inc.* (2017, N.D. Cal.) – further established that copyleft licenses create enforceable obligations.  
- *Hellwig v. VMware* (Germany, 2016–2021) – highlighted international enforceability of GPL terms.  

These and other cases demonstrate that open-source licenses function as binding legal instruments, not merely guidelines.  

Accordingly, contributions to this project are accepted with the intent to preserve neutrality and prevent restrictions based on geography, politics, or sanctions.
